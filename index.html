This was to fit the identity of the shop which was vintage and professional. The colour scheme also reflected this as I restricted it to only black and white. The logo also reflected in this with it's badge style but not getting too busy with designs, almost reflecting a seal of sorts.</p></a>

I wanted to create badges for iconic locations in Marvel movies. I was trying to emulate the style of vintage national park style badges. For the Wakanda and Sokovia designs I stuck to the countries flag colours as the main colour palette. I also chose to outline the landscape of the locations to serve as a midground for each badge.</p></a>

I also wanted to give the typical browsing screen a more dynamic look, that focuses on making profiles easily visible instead of jamming as many on the screen at once as you can. I also wanted to keep the colours fun and modern while also staying gender neutral.</p></a>

The label is rather simplistic, allowing the logo to stand out the most. This is because of the idea of changing the colour of the wine in the logo, depending on the flavor of wine being sold. The background of each label is also a different pigment and shade than the last blue to act as the sky but still contrast well against the wine colour in the bottle.</p></a>

This current design is much more modern and readable. The idea of the logo was combining a battery to represent power and a tall skyscraper to represent centre. I also kept the colour scheme of their current logo as well because it fits well with their brand.</p></a>

It was made to manage your negative or poor social media posts that you could regret posting. Whenever you submitted a post it would stay locked for an amount of time you set (1-24hrs). After the time was up you would get a notification to come back to the post and submit it to social media. I wanted the skunk tail to be the main identifier for the app and the green color scheme went along with it for theming. I wanted the app to feel very modern but simple to use as it's main demographic was young and possibly intoxicated people.</p></a>

The rest of the interface was based around that with a black fade behind the buttons. Since the album art took up a lot of the screen, the I based the button's colours on the default menu button colours for the Apple Smart Watch. The second screen is rather basic however I tried to easily show all of the song's identifiers with it's title, artist, and art.</p></a>

The colour scheme was primarily white and red as those are the main colours of Canada.</p></a>

I used the raised hands to represent voting while singling out the middle one in red to represent your vote. It also ties in with the other use of red being the checkmark in vote and the word 'vote' in the hashtag. The colour scheme is consistent with the website as well as it's fonts being similar. The background was made up of blurred newspaper clippings to represent all of the politics in the news to learn about.</p></a>

This is a redesign of their landing page that completely updates their brand. It features all of the most important details at the top of the page. I tried to match the colour scheme of the website to what the hotel seemed to have of blues and whites. I also made sure that the website was still rather simple as the general audience for the hotel seemed to be of an elder age.</p></a>
